# LIVE_WEB_CHAT_APPLICATION
I built this project using nodeJS, and made use of websocket: i.e SOCKET.IO to create a multi-user chat application  

PROVIDES THESE FEATURES:
1. Socket.io is a Javascript library for web apps that allows real-time communication between clients and servers
2. Emit and receive events to/from Socket.io running in the server
3. Add our own messages to the chat via JavaScript
4. Multiple users can join in for live chatting , other users will be notified when a new user enter or leaves a chat.
